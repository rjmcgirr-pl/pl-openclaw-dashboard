- Browser automation unavailable - Chrome extension relay not attached
- Manual screenshot capture required

---

## Issues Found

### 🔴 Critical Issues:
1. **Browser testing infrastructure incomplete**
   - Chrome tab must be manually attached via OpenClaw Browser Relay toolbar icon
   - Without attachment, automated UI testing cannot proceed

### 🟡 Warnings:
1. **Incomplete end-to-end testing**
   - Login flow not verified through UI
   - Task CRUD operations not tested via UI automation
   - Console errors not inspected

---

## Recommendations

1. **For Complete QA Testing:**
   - Open https://openclaw.propertyllama.com in Chrome
   - Click the OpenClaw Browser Relay toolbar icon (badge should show ON)
   - Re-run browser automation tests

2. **Manual Testing Checklist:**
   - [ ] Enter password and verify login works
   - [ ] Create a new task in each column
   - [ ] Edit an existing task
   - [ ] Move tasks between columns via drag-and-drop
   - [ ] Switch to Cron Monitor tab and verify it loads
   - [ ] Open browser DevTools (F12) and check for console errors
   - [ ] Verify auto-refresh works (wait 30 seconds)

3. **API Testing (with valid credentials):**
   ```bash
   curl -H "X-Dashboard-Password: YOUR_PASSWORD" \
        https://taskboard-api.rei-workers.workers.dev/tasks
   ```

## Final Assessment

**Overall: ⚠️ PARTIAL — INFRASTRUCTURE LIMITATION**

The dashboard infrastructure is verified as operational:
- ✅ Site loads correctly
- ✅ API is responsive
- ✅ Authentication is enforced
- ✅ All expected UI components exist in codebase

However, **complete browser automation testing could not be completed** due to the Chrome extension relay not being attached to the tab. This is a tooling limitation, not a product issue.

**Recommendation:** Proceed with manual verification of the checklist above, or re-run automated tests after attaching the Chrome tab to the OpenClaw Browser Relay.
